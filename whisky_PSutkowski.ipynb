    "1. What interesting information user can find in the dataset?\n",
    " A. 109 whiskies are described by 5 characteristics: color (14 options),nose (12 options),body (8 options), palate (15 options), finish (19 options). For each characteristic, 1 whisky can have only 1 option selected.\n",
    " B. for each whisky there is distillery assigned. Distillery might be identified by geographical coordinates (latitude/longitude) and region/district (which indicates macrogeographic location, such as proximity to the sea, altiude etc.)\n",
    " C. for each whisky there is score indicating quality (varies from 55% to 90%): score is based on one of references invoked in \"Lapointe, F.-J. & P. Legendre. 1994. A classification of pure malt Scotch whiskies.\" study, which is starting point for this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Therefore, multiple studies can be considered:\n",
    " A. relation between whisky quality score and different characteristics: check if whiskies scoring higher are more likely to have certain values of color,nose, body, palate and finish ?\n",
    " B. relation between distillery location/district/region and whisky's characteristics: is there any ? (for example, if distilleries of lower altitude tend to produce whisky of certain colour ?)\n",
    " C. similarity of whiskies (being analazyed in further part if this study): given characteristics for each whisky, how \"similar\" they are to each other ?\n"
